## Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a challenging task that can be efficiently solved using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Fraudulent transactions can be identified by analyzing patterns in historical data, such as transaction amounts, locations, and times. ML algorithms can be trained to learn these patterns and then used to predict the likelihood of a new transaction being fraudulent.
